    "### Step 5: Creating a subscriber\n",
    "The node we just created is very basic and does not do anything. Recall from notebook **00_ros2_project_introduction.ipynb** that different kinds of data is sent between nodes in a *publish-subscriber* manner. The data is sent to a topic, and nodes that want to retrive the data can subscribe to the topic. To build on our new node, let us create a subscriber. Before we do that, imagine you are going to send a package in the mail to your friend who lives on the other side of the country. Before sending the mail you need to decide how to encapsulate the package, for example with a box or just an envelope. Then you have to decide where you are going to send the package; probably to the nearest post office. The same thing applies here. We need to decide which data type the data will be store in, as well as where the data will be sent so that our subscriber can retrive it. Unlike the case where you send a package to your friend, in ROS 2 we have to decide what *happens* when a new mail (message) is received. This logic happens in a *callback*, which is a method that is called when a message is received.\n",
